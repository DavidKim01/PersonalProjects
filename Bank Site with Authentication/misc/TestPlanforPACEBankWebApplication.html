<h1>Test Plan for PACE Bank Web Application</h1>
<p><strong>Author</strong>: David Kim</p>
<h2>1 Testing Strategy</h2>
<h3>1.1 Overall strategy</h3>
<p>Unit testing will be done on a function to function basis through peer code review and using testing technologies such as Mocha individually. As for integration testing, all testing will be automated as to ensure that time is used efficiently to focus more on important aspects of implementing the software. Finally, regression-testing will be performed everytime a new feature is added or changed as well.</p>
<h3>1.2 Test Selection and Adequacy Criterion</h3>
<p>Combination of both white and black box(grey) testing techniques could help the app development process be quicker. Since some attributes only require simple test where the condition might change from true to false we can use use black box testing. While other attribute involves multiple parts of the function working in unison, which requires a more in depth look of white box testing.</p>
<p>For this app I used simple testing of our functionality doing QA duties whenever a new feature is added. Through direct manipulation of the app using a local server all tests were successful in the final build.</p>
